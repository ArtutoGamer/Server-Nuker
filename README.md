# Server Nuker
Are you pissed at a server that your staff in? 

Do you fucking hate the server owner?

Do you want to watch ~~the world~~ a Discord server burn?

Well I got the perfect program for you! Server Nuker!

Server Nuker is a Node.js program that will destroy any Discord server that you have Admin/Mod/Staff in.

# Disclaimer


This program is **very powerful.** It took just a second or 2 to **ban everyone in the server, and delete all roles/channels.**. I am not responsible for any damage you do with this tool, or any punishments you get from the server owners, **or even Discord Staff (They could ban your account for API abuse)**. Please use this tool on an alt account.


# Install

Once the program has connected to the API, run one of the commands below in te server you want to destroy.
# Commands

`!destroy` -**Bans everyone, deletes all channels and roles, and sets the server name to a raided message.**

`!overwrite` - Does the same thing as `!destroy`, but creates tons of channels and roles. Useful if you don't want the server owners to be able to recover from this.
